Display a single-image super-fast loading Google map in a widget. A larger map with all the usual features is available on click in a lightbox.

== Description ==

More features, videos and demos are coming in a few days! Till then here's the widget's features list:

* title
* address
* thumbnail map pin color
* thumbnail map width/height
* thumbnail map zoom level
* thumbnail map type
* lightbox map width/height
* lightbox map zoom level
* lightbox map type
* lightbox footer text


There are no additional JS libraries included; GMW uses jQuery and jQuery UI Dialog bundled with WP. There are also no CSS files, but will be in the future 'cause we want to make the dialog look nicer :)

== Installation ==

Follow the usual routine;

1. Download the plugin.
2. Unzip it and upload to wp-content/plugin/
3. Open WP admin - Plugins and click "Activate" next to the plugin
4. Configure the plugin under Appearance - Widgets


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for? =

For just about anyone who needs a map on their site.

= It's not working!!! Arrrrrrrrr =

A more detailed help is coming soon. Till then check 2 things: does your theme have wp_footer() function call in the footer and if there are any jQuery errors on the site.
If you can figure it out open a thread in the support forums.

== Screenshots ==

1. Small map is shown as a widget and since it's just one image loads super-fast
2. Larger map with all features is available in the lightbox
